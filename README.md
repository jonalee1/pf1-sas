# SAS Enterprise Miner Data Mining Examples
## Overview
This repository contains example diagrams and materials for using SAS Enterprise Miner to perform data mining.

The repository includes XML files (which represent SAS Enterprise Miner process flow diagrams) for association analysis, 
clustering, credit scoring, ensemble modeling, predictive modeling, survival analysis, text mining, time series, and accompanying PDF files to help guide you through the process flow diagrams.

- [/Clustering] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Clustering. 
- [/CreditScoring] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Credit Scoring. 
- [/EnsembleModeling] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Ensemble Modeling. 
- [/MARS] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). 
- [/PredictiveModeling] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Predictive Modeling. 
- [/SurvivalAnalysis] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Survival Analysis. 
- [/TextMining] contains XML and PDF files about running an example for Text Mining.  Getting Started 

Download (and unzip) or clone this repository. The repository contains one directory for each data mining topic 
(clustering, survival analysis, and so on). Each directory contains one or more example XML files (diagrams) 
and associated PDF documentation. 

To run these examples:

1. Create a new Project or open an existing project in SAS Enterprise Miner. 

2. Right-click on the Diagrams folder in the top left corner, and select "Import Diagram from XML." Select the 
  XML file from one of the directories, and open the corresponding PDF document to learn about the technique 
  implemented in the example.

  NOTE: You can import multiple XML files into the same SAS Enterprise Miner project or you can choose to 
  create a separate project for every topic.

3. Right-click on the last node and select "Run" to run the process flow diagram.
